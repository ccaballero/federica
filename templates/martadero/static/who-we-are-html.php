<p>mARTadero is a comprehensive, social development project operating through
art and culture.</p>

<p>As a comprehensive project for the development of arts and culture towards
social change, <strong>we work for social development through art and culture
</strong>, doing so through <strong><a href="#areas">7 areas of artistic
creation</a></strong> and <strong><a href="#programas">7 social development
programs</a></strong>, both based on <strong><a href="#principios">7
principles</a></strong>. Each of the strategies we implement is in turn based
on 3 pillars:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Space:</strong> the architectural space of the former
    slaughterhouse: 3,000 m² built in 1924, with its clear patrimonial character
    and awaiting declaration as heritage, expresses the yearning for progress
    which is typical of turn of the century industrial architecture. A unique,
    flexible and well-defined space which is decentralized, socially and
    geographically strategic, and in keeping with the logic and the needs of
    emerging arts. It has been lent for use for 30 years to NADA for the
    self-managed development of the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural management:</strong> a multidisciplinary and open
    professional team with a deep command of intercultural promotion in the
    local, national and international sphere. An autonomous group working on an
    assembly basis; well-structured, focused on obtaining results that are clear
    and pertinent for society; capable of renewing itself and adjusting to
    contemporary standards; convinced of the advantages of staying connected,
    networking and reaching a consensus regarding the Culture of the Future.
    </li>
    <li><strong>The principles:</strong> seven maxims founded upon the clear
    objectives of innovation, research, experimentation; proposing conceptual
    and formal stringency, integration, exchange and interculturality as the
    criteria to be applied to all the proposals that are generated, supported or
    organized by the project. These principles convey the project's core values
    and communicate our belief in the potential for creating a better future.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="areas"></a>7 ARTISTIC CREATION AREAS</h2>
<p>During the six years of the mARTadero Project's existence, we have carried
out close to 800 different activities involving over 200,000 participants.
Today, mARTadero is the most innovative and fastest growing cultural project in
Bolivia and serves as an exemplary project in the region, thanks to the work of
over thirty people that have during this time contributed with their effort and
their capacity for management. An important part of this achievement is the
'seven artistic areas', the aim of which is to enhance and develop their area of
activity in the city of Cochabamba not only through exhibitions but also by
activating training and development mechanisms with a special penchant for
emerging arts. Please find below the specific objectives of each area:</p>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/estrella-areas.jpg') ?>" title="Artistic creation areas" /></p>

<h3>VISUAL ARTS AND PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/artes-visuales.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero visual arts" /></p>
<p>The aim of this area is to position contemporary visual creations in the
Bolivian and international scenes through exhibits, events, exchanges,
participation in international networks, training workshops, support of Bolivian
artists abroad etc. The position of art as a space for social construction
through a multidimensional deployment of creativity in the context is a core
theme.</p>

<h3>LITERATURE</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/letras.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero literature" /></p>
<p>In the Literature area we try to promote the creation, circulation and
exchange of literary proposals through workshops, production and participation
in writing-related activities, both at national and international level. Also, a
special focus is given to knowledge acquired through individual and collective
experience in order to foster new voices in poetry and prose that are more
aware, critical and proactive regarding themselves and the context they live
in.</p>

<h3>PERFORMING ARTS</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/artes-escenicas.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero performing arts" /></p>
<p>This area seeks to enhance the training of Bolivian creators thanks to the
production of activities linked to the different trends and genres that make up
performing arts (Theater, Dance, Puppetry etc.) We also look after the
consideration of context in these expressions as a source of creation and social
construction. The activities are assessed and carried out in correspondence with
the guiding principles for all projects developing in mARTadero.</p>

<h3>GRAPHIC DESING AND ARCHITECTURE</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/arquitectura.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero architecture" /></p>
<p>In this area we try to contribute to the development of graphic design and
architecture in Cochabamba and Bolivia thanks to an interdisciplinary approach
at different levels through training, projects, meetings, networking and
significant interventions. Likewise, we guided the progressive recovery of the
old slaughterhouse, revitalizing its heritage essence and refurbishing the
different spaces for cultural and artistic use by the city. The same thing has
been done to other historical buildings, always taking into account the
environmental and bioclimatic dimensions of architecture.</p>

<h3>MEDIA</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/audiovisual.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero media" /></p>
<p>This area aims at encouraging experimental and professional media production
in our environment; promoting and producing creative, educative activities and
exhibitions of diverse genres and trends. We pledge our commitment to an
interdisciplinary approach to art; to exploring audiovisual language and to
designing an alternative production rationale in line with our economic and
cultural context.</p>

<h3>MUSIC</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/musica.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero music" /></p>
<p>In this area we want to facilitate, promote and disseminate the production of
music events (concerts, workshops etc) without discrimination against any
musical genre and with an interdisciplinary approach. We prioritize and focus
our work on musical creations by new artists, especially those who experiment in
composition and who, for diverse reasons, do not have access to spaces where
they can develop and express their art and talent.</p>

<h3>SOCIAL INTERACTION</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('interaccion-social.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero social interaction" /></p>
<p>This area tries to enhance social development processes through art and
culture strategies, generating a progressive future-orientated movement based on
creativity and in the crucial role of culture as a facilitator for inclusion,
environmental awareness, economic production and social cohesion. Also, we look
for interaction between artists and the general public, paying special attention
to the new generations that are the true builders of a culture of future.</p>

<h2><a name="programas"></a>7 SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS</h2>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/programas-desarrollo.jpg') ?>" title="Social development programs" /></p>

<h3>FREE EXPRESSION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION CHILDREN’S WORKSHOP</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/taller-infantil.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero children's workshop" /></p>
<p>The Workshop is an open space where proposals can be made and whose objective
is for children to be able to freely explore their creativity through games,
handicrafts of all types, drawings and building blocks. We want them to find a
project to carry out under the supervision of the team of instructors, who are
in charge of managing the group according to its needs. Socializing while having
fun, meeting others, recycling, reusing and other dimensions of this workshop
allow children to live art as a means to assimilate the world that surrounds
them.</p>

<h3>FORMARTE</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/formarte.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero formARTe" /></p>
<p>This is a program and a space for complementary, high quality and intensive
artistic training at an affordable cost aimed mostly at young people. Its main
objective is to serve as a knowledge exchange forum where social, personal and
cultural change can happen from and through art. It is self-financed thanks to
the fee paid by the participants –a minimum of 8-. There are full and partial
grants for the economically disadvantaged.</p>
<p><a href="<?php // TODO ?>http://www.martadero.org/programas/formarte.html%20">http://www.martadero.org/programas/formarte.html</a></p>

<h3>URBAN ACTION (ART SQUARE AND ART WALK)</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/accion-urbana.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero urban action" /></p>
<p>The Project, supported by Eje Centr4l, is based on the sparking off of a
process of citizen participation that promotes renovation, refurbishing and the
search for new meaning for the Arrieros de Cochabamba Square (Bolivia); to turn
it into the Arts Square and, by extension, the Art Walk that spans a specific
area. These spaces are intended to serve as a meeting point where people's
creativity can be developed, where recreation, fun, leisure and rest can be
combined. The process aims at promoting reflection and awareness among the
residents; to aspire to a gradual improvement in the context of their living
situation.</p>

<h4>Mission:</h4>
<p>Creating a multifaceted public space where signs of diversity are an element
of richness and not a factor of exclusion.</p>
<h4>Purpose:</h4>
<p>Rebuilding a feeling of community, belonging and collective responsibility in
the neighborhood of Villa Coronilla, facilitating the encounter and the exchange
of ideas among neighbors.</p>
<h4>Specific objectives:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Create a permanent mechanism for amassing the history of the
    neighborhood.</li>
    <li>Activate a massive flow of communication among neighbors regarding the
    neighborhood's issues.</li>
    <li>Facilitate the creation of a structure that allows the neighbors to
    collectively build models for the future, as a material and organizational
    platform to spark off dialogue and the exchange of ideas among the
    inhabitants of the neighborhood of Villa Coronilla.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ALIVE AND GREEN</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/vivo-y-verde.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero alive and green" /></p>
<p>The main objective of this program is to transmit an environmental awareness
to the people in the neighborhood and to those visiting us. The premise is to
reuse waste (water and solids) and to reduce the amount of garbage. MARTadero
has different bins to separate waste according to its composition (plastics,
organic waste, compost, glass etc), and we want this to serve as an example that
can be replicated at home. Likewise, we are going to install composting toilets
that turn septic waste into fertilizer for gardens and orchards through a
natural process.</p>

<h3>PRANA ART RESIDENCIES</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/prana.jpg') ?>" title="Prana mARTadero" /></p>
<p><strong>PRANA</strong> is a Sanskrit word that refers to "what is vital",
<strong>to the strength of living things and to the generation of energy through
the natural process of the Universe</strong>. It comes from the Upanishads and
it talks about that part of physical reality that supports the body, and is the
origin of mind and thought.</p>
<p>PRANA (Program of Artistic Residencies of NADA) is a program based on the
rooms built in our space, proposed by Fundación Imagen and with the
collaboration of the Embassy of the Netherlands. Resident artists and cultural
managers have one to four weeks (in the case of national artists) and four to
eight weeks (international artists) to produce a work. The proposal -either
physical or process-based- must contribute to the neighborhood of Villa
Coronilla or the city of Cochabamba, searching social interaction between
citizens and the artist's work.</p>
<p>The idea is to conceive artistic projects pertinent to the place, that can be
carried out during the stay and that incorporate the context, allowing
interaction with it.</p>
<p>The receiving center, through foundations, will take care of raising the
funds for the material and the equipment necessary for producing the work.</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is a top capacity of 8 persons (4 in each room) in PRANA-North and
    6 in PRANA-South, which makes a total of 14.</li>
    <li>Artists and managers who come with residency programs will have priority
    over other guests.</li>
    <li>Artists interested in staying as independents, outside of residency
    programs, will also have the possibility of doing so.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CULTURAL POLICIES AND NETWORKS</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/politicas-culturales.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero cultural policies" /></p>
<p>Cultural policies are understood as "the area of public policy-making that
governs activities related to the arts and culture. Generally, this involves
fostering processes, legal classifications and institutions which promote
cultural diversity and accessibility, as well as enhancing and circulating the
artistic, sociolinguistic and literary expressions of all people".</p>
<p>This program aims at enhancing the advancement of Cultural Policy in our
country, since the possibility for opening up the debate through communication
platforms arises as a need of contemporary democratic societies. This is why we
are hoping to enable this debate through a blog, a symbol of reciprocity and
opinion-exchange open spaces. We want this to be the contribution of the
mARTadero Project to the current gestation of a cultural policy for our country.
We thus try to promote three specific, high priority laws: one on Culture
Centers, another on Cultural Spaces and a last one linked to Artistic Promotion
Grant Funds.</p>

<h3>ARTISTIC AND CULTURAL BUSINESS INCUBATOR</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/vivero.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero incubator" /></p>
<p>One of the main problems of the culture and arts sector is that it does not
rely on necessary expertise for advancing in the business world nor for
establishing legal institutions. Likewise, it lacks an adequate organizational
structure to establish market relations at a national and international level.
This is the reason why we are proposing -together with Fundación Imagen- a
project that supports enterprising artists, allowing them to use their
creativity to set a comprehensive strategy that contributes to economic and
social development in Bolivia. The main objective is to get to provide those
interested in artistic jobs with an environment equipped with the necessary
infrastructures, marketing advice, sales and trading, business tutors or mentors
and management follow-up support, among other things.</p>
<p>The objective of this program is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To promote the economic development of the arts sector, contributing to
    the organization of the culture and creativity sector and to its recognition
    as a field with an increasingly important role in the world's economic
    dynamics.</li>
    <li>To entitle artists to start artistic and creative business, and to
    strengthen the very few existing ones, providing a space with technical and
    logistical equipment for them to consolidate their work in a professional
    way, thus strengthening quality cultural offerings.</li>
    <li>Providing the necessary tools regarding the different management areas,
    business management and new technologies in the culture and arts field.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="principios"></a>7 PRINCIPLES</h2>
<p>The criteria that we apply to all our proposals are based on the same
principles enshrined in NADA&rsquo;s rules of association, which are the 3 main
pillars of the project:</p>

<h3>INNOVATION</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/innovacion.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero innovation" /></p>
<p>An innovative proposal is one in which conceptual contents go beyond what is
given or established and which setting or formal aspects are coherent with the
uniqueness of the content.</p>

<h3>RESEARCH</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/investigacion.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero research" /></p>
<p>The proposal must be the result of research and consideration of the contents
and their social and cultural implications.</p>

<h3>EXPERIMENTING</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/experimentacion.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero experimenting" /></p>
<p>A proposal is experimental when the contents, and thus the implementation,
question in a responsible way the limits of what is artistically or esthetically
established.</p>

<h3>CONCEPTUAL AND FORMAL STRINGENCY</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/rigor.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero conceptual and formal stringency" /></p>
<p>The conceptual and formal stringency of a proposal refers both to the logical
coherence of its conceptual approach as well as to the accomplishment of its
implementation.</p>

<h3>INTEGRATION</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/integracion.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero integration" /></p>
<p>Integration is a broad concept  that involves the capacity of integrating
artistic disciplines or languages, as well as the need for social and cultural
integration from a plural perspective.</p>

<h3>KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE EXCHANGE</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/intercambio.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero exchange" /></p>
<p>It refers to the need for a proposal to have a knowledge-based impact on
society, in such a way that it can generate knowledge rather than the
accumulation of information. It refers to the critical capacity arising from an
integrating, communal, dialogic and dialectic knowledge.</p>

<h3>INTERCULTURALITY</h3>
<p><img src="<?php echo $this->staticUrl('/interculturalidad.jpg') ?>" title="mARTadero interculturality" /></p>
<p>Interculturality means not only to respect cultural diversity but to enhance,
know and value its artistic and cultural manifestations.</p>
<p>We are convinced that when art and culture are alive and shared, this has an
essential impact on development and social wellbeing. That is why we consider it
a priority to create a broad and inclusive (physically and conceptually) space
for creation.</p>

<h2>Our space must therefore serve the purpose of:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Synergistic creation and multidisciplinary innovation in arts and
    culture.</li>
    <li>Visibility and accessibility of emerging culture offerings.</li>
    <li>Research and implementation of new culture management models.</li>
    <li>Social interaction and integration through art.</li>
    <li>Going beyond national limits and boundaries towards a true
    interculturality based on dynamic and inclusive identities.</li>
    <li>Identifying leaders that enable the emergence of processes.</li>
    <li>Generating flows and networking.</li>
</ul>
